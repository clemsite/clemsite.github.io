    Walking Leo
</p>
<p>
    Kareem, Rayan and I emerge onto the street out of the ominous black gates
    of their house on Grove End Road, and head east towards the tube stop. Leo
    is golden, glowing with perfect precision, and pulls Rayan along. We are
    talking, or maybe rather I am talking, non-stop, and I am holding a
    skateboard. How many times have we walked this path before?
</p>
<p>
    There is a cricket game at Lord’s Cricket Ground and everyone is blobbed in
    our way as we walk past the station, wearing those
    orange-and-yellow-striped ties that everyone wears when there’s a game at
    Lord’s. We all agree we don’t know why everyone wears them when there’s a
    game at Lord’s. We turn south off Acacia Road onto St. Anne’s Terrace,
    which becomes the High Street. The Duke of York bursts with people who
    either want to watch the game or already saw it. Rayan and Leo are briefly
    lost in the crowd, possibly stuck, and I deeply empathize with Rayan’s
    stuckness, but am too delighted to emerge from the crowd myself to try to
    help him. He emerges several seconds later anyways, Leo tugging him out by
    the lead.
</p>
<p>
    We turn onto the cobbled Charles Lane, just south of Gelato Mio, still
    talking. Several small children once tried to mug me, Shahid and Tina here.
    At the end of it, we turn right, and going south on Charlbert Street there
    is a miraculous conflux at its intersection with Allitsen Road, wherein Mo
    and Adib park right next to where we are walking and yell something that
    makes us jump before we realize it’s them. Two women in hijabs walk by, and
    they grin at something Mo says to them in Arabic as he gets out of the car.
    I don’t know Mo but he has a very thin nose and is wearing a fedora. Adib
    is just so happy to see Leo, and after all it’s a beautiful and gorgeous
    day that occasionally vibrates with satisfaction. Leo is grinning, and he’s
    happy to see Adib as well. We walk towards the New Inn, where Adib and Mo
    want to get a pint or something. Kareem’s hair is insane. I think I give
    Adib my American phone number because we’re going to meet them later.
</p>
<p>
    We keep going down Charlbert and finally get to the park, and I skateboard
    down the little hill, and then the bridge across the canal, and up to the
    Outer Circle road. The small greebles of the pavement vibrate up through
    the wheels and massage my feet. There’s something electric about concrete
    with moss growing out of it that makes itself known to me. I wait for the
    twins, and we cross the road together. Rayan lets Leo off the lead, and he
    surges forward, sprinting, and then jumps over the fence and then jumps
    back over and heads for the thick of the park. Rayan and Kareem walk on
    either side of me as I roll on the skateboard. Leo stops way ahead of us on
    the path to look back at Rayan, posing in the dappled tree light and
    smiling. He waits for a few seconds and then hurls himself forwards again
    towards the grass and the people. There are so many people. Ohh no Rayan
    says, because Leo is, like, in someone’s picnic. Everyone is playing
    softball, including the woman guarding the picnic. She doesn’t seem to be
    too bothered by Leo even though I strongly feel that he ate something, but
    she doesn’t have a real face right now so it’s hard to tell.
</p>
<p>
    Now we are walking again, Leo back on the lead because it must be softball
    day in the park and there are all these people from America acting like
    Americans. Seven glistening shirtless men with tiny shorts come charging at
    us on the path, and I know they are going to trample us or stick us with
    spears. They are in a pack, I don’t know, primordial warriors or something.
    But they are just training. I want to tell them it’s irresponsible to run
    in a pack like that because it’s terrifying. We stop and watch a softball
    game for a while. Kareem’s hair is like small-knotted rams’ horns, and he
    has dark rings under his eyes. Softball, I have just realized, is very very
    interesting.
</p>
<p>
    The team fielding the ball right now is a single organic machine that stops
    the ball midflight, absorbs its momentum with an elasticity that flings the
    ball back to home at the same speed it left. We stare at them for a long
    time, entranced, discussing softball. The men in tiny shorts seem to be
    doing laps, and keep running past us as we head to where the Honest Sausage
    used to be. With each pass, they are still causing me to feel the wide-eyed
    terror of a sheep about to be slaughtered, but I’m getting used to it. I
    get back on the skateboard and a breeze kicks up at my back. The grass is
    so rich with color it ripples. I kick forward again and I can feel my
    t-shirt billowing deliberately. I take the left fork of the path, ride
    along the pavement between fields of tall yellow-tipped grass, soaring, the
    tear-dropped flaxen tips so fine that they never reach a point.
</p>
<p>
    Now Mo and Adib have found us. Adib is really angry because he tossed back
    a stray softball that rolled onto the path, and no one said thank you. We
    carry on, following the curved path that will bring us alongside the zoo.
    The trees begin arching over our heads. Like the grass, and Leo’s beautiful
    golden hair, their leaves seem too precise to find completion. Flashes of
    sharpness glow where the sun sifts through the upper canopy. How’s Saudi,
    Mo? Kareem asks. Mo doesn’t like it, he says. We all agree we love St.
    John’s Wood. Some animals in the zoo make noises. In the shifting, layered
    procession of large walking groups, Kareem falls back towards Adib, I am
    talking to Mo. He works for a defense contractor in Saudi, and he explains
    what that means. I nod, smiling. It is completely incomprehensible to me.
</p>
<p>
    Adib, Mo and Leo go off with Adib’s girlfriend to Primrose Hill, but we
    head back to Kareem and Rayan’s place where we have forgotten that Julian
    is waiting for us.
