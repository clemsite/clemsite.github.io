    Pillars of Salt
</p>
<p>
    I am sitting at a faux-wooden table in a small, square, fluorescent-lit
    multipurpose room somewhere in the depths of the Westminster Public
    Library, getting badly beaten at chess by Richard, although he doesn’t know
    it yet. Richard, who told me that the Westminster Library has strange
    properties and changes the weather when he’s inside, has no hair on his
    arms. Richard sits leaning forward on his elbows at all times, even when
    it’s my turn, except to write down his or my move on a score sheet. He
    uncaps his fountain pen, carefully records the progression in abbreviated
    notation, and then recaps his pen. He slides his palms over his ears and
    splays his fingers out across the sides of his head, running them through
    his thinning and wiry grey hair. Richard has a beard that makes him look
    like Vincent Van Gogh’s <em>Self Portrait with Straw Hat</em>.
</p>
<p>
    To my left, at the other end of the rectangular table, two men are deeply
    immersed in a match of their own. The one on Richard’s side of the table,
    probably in his mid fifties, has long thin hair but is starting to bald.
    He’s wearing a pill-covered white sweater that eases the transition between
    his thin arms and large belly. He looks like he could be asleep. On the
    back of his chair hangs a green-and-black-checkered blazer. His opponent is
    a portly Indian man with a thick moustache. Behind me, at a table parallel
    to ours, someone is playing himself. I am the only person in this room
    under forty.
</p>
<p>
    In the corner of the room to Richard’s left, there is an easel pad with
    unrelated phrases written all over it, like “Where am I?” and “I like
    dogs.” I realize only now that it was to this that Richard was referring
    when he said (seemingly out of nowhere) “Mary was trying to teach me to
    teach English,” when I first walked into the room thirty minutes ago. He
    then said, “She’s like…” and he paused for a long, long time. “She’s like
    one of those characters in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>” and then softly
    “Yeah. … Yeah. The room changes shape according to where she sits.” And
    then, even more softly, something about geometry.
</p>
<p>
    Richard and I are somewhere in the loosely defined middle game. I’ve just
    lost a strategically advanced pawn that was giving me control of the center
    of the board. I move my knight forward, putting pressure on his queen, but
    leaving my own rook on the back rank susceptible to his rook on the back
    rank. Richard snorts. He leans back and rests his hand over his mouth. He
    shakes his head. I am not sure whether this means he thinks I’ve made a
    good move or a bad move. I have no idea, though, so I’m awaiting further
    cues. Since the start of the game, I can tell that he’s been trying to feel
    out my skill level, and since the start, I’ve been trying to feel out the
    moment he realizes I don’t know what I’m doing.
</p>
<p>
    The grandmasters of chess can usually think six moves ahead. Deep Blue, the
    chess-playing robot that beat Kasparov in 1997, can think a maximum of
    twenty moves ahead. I, on the other hand, am not thinking ahead at all, and
    I think that the apparent random nature of my moves is almost too random,
    and I think Richard isn’t sure if I’m an idiot or a genius.
</p>
<p>
    “Very obvious move,” he mutters as he takes my rook with his. There it is,
    I think, my cover is blown. I don’t know why it was such an obvious move,
    since my other rook and my queen support that square, so there’s definitely
    something I don’t understand. I retake with my queen anyways. I suspect
    Richard has caught me in some fiendish trap. He takes all of five seconds
    to move his queen diagonally into the unguarded center, an aggressive move,
    but one that does not immediately threaten any of my pieces. I move a pawn
    forward so that it threatens to take his queen, and he quickly counters by
    moving it one square to the right. He still does not hesitate, and there is
    still no immediate threat to any of my pieces. What are you planning,
    Richard?
</p>
<p>
    The potential diagonal moves he can make with his queen have all shifted,
    and I notice that this has opened up a square in the center. I move my
    knight forward again, posing a weak threat to his back rank rook. He gives
    very little thought to this and moves his rook in front of my knight. Then
    his eyes widen. His head snaps up, his back straightens and he snatches his
    rook with a violence.
</p>
<p>
    “Can I still…?” he says with a tight voice, asking if he can undo his move
    even though he took his hand off the piece. I give him a thumbs up and he
    puts the rook back.
</p>
<p>
    “Might get pushed off the back rank. Wouldn’t be so good. Actually I think
    that would’ve been disastrous,” he says. I nod, pretending I know what he’s
    talking about. I think somehow I have reestablished my credibility. Then I
    see it: Had I allowed his rook to take my knight the next turn, I would’ve
    been able to move my queen all the way to his back rank, and it would’ve
    been checkmate. If he hadn’t taken the knight, I would’ve moved it to
    threaten his queen, which he would have had to move, and I would then move
    my knight again, forking his rook and king. He would be forced to move his
    king, I would take the rook, his next move is inconsequential, and then I
    would move my queen down the column and once more, it would be checkmate—at
    least, I’m pretty sure. I imagine the thoughts running through Richard’s
    head: that I had been setting this up the whole time, that exchanging rooks
    was all building up to this master stroke, that I was a strategic genius,
    thinking miles ahead. We’re right back where we started, aren’t we Richard?
</p>
<p>
    If you were watching the room from a bird’s eye view, with the door in the
    bottom left hand corner of your vision, you would see my quiffed brown hair
    slightly to the right of the middle of the bottom side, about to have my
    hat handed to me, seated at one of two tables running vertically down the
    room. Spinning counter-clockwise until the tables run horizontally,
    separating the space into alternating rows of tables and non-tables, you
    would see Richard’s wiry corona in the bottom left, and in the right, a
    greasy-looking part separating long veils that almost reach the man’s belt.
    Spinning another ninety degrees, you would see black bushy locks slightly
    to the left of the middle of the bottom side, and if you listened closely,
    you would hear the leg of the person to whom the hair belonged shaking the
    table ever so slightly, twitching like a hare. In the bottom right I am
    unsure of what you would see; a man came in fifteen minutes into our game
    and sat down but I never turned around to see him.
</p>
<p>
    If you were to speed backwards, you would travel through the cardboard
    ceiling tiles, through the structural support, wood flooring and cheap
    carpet into the room above. You would find yourself amongst medical
volumes, like the    <em>Textbook of Clinical Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience</em>
    and <em>The Oxford Textbook of Medicine</em>.<em> </em>If you kept going
    you would zoom through another low ceiling, and into the ‘C’s of the vast
    fiction section, and then into another floor of unknown content, and if you
    kept going still you would shoot out into the drizzly night air, and still
    rising, you would find yourself hovering above all of Marylebone, and you’d
    be able to see my route home, threaded through the constellations of street
    lamps.
</p>
<p>
    The route is simple: a long stretch south of two blocks and then one to the
    west. One more block south would leave me in front of our apartment. The
    westward block, Crawford Street, is on my daily route to school. It runs
    past a Thai restaurant, a tiny art gallery that is seldom visited by
    anyone, a printing.com, a FedEx that assures everyone year-round, “WE HAVE
    BOXES!”, a Yazco carpet emporium, a store that sells only Swedish stuff and
    a church.
</p>
<p>
    Late Saturday night, three days ago, I am walking home down Crawford
    Street, stoned and paranoid, and I keep thinking about how everything could
    be disappearing that isn’t in my immediate cone of vision, how we can only
    fill in from memory everything that’s not in front of us. I start to
    question the reality of what I can’t see, to question whether everything
    isn’t actually disappearing, and suddenly I am walking with my back to a
    yawning chasm, and I don’t want to blink and lose everything in front of me
    too and the wind is sharp and cold and my eyes start watering. I want to
    turn around but I can’t make myself do it, and I can’t stop and I can’t go.
    Eventually I make myself look back, and everything is there, the cars, the
    lampposts, the dark storefronts of shops.
</p>
<p align="center">
    ♔
</p>
<p>
    On my way to attend my first Marylebone Chess Club meeting, I walked east
    past the Yazco and the printing.com and the Thai restaurant. The moon was
    shining through the edges of the swelling clouds. I wound my way north
    through the headlight trails of Gloucester Road and the sweet shisha smoke
    of the Arab cafés and shouldered through the swinging wooden door of the
    Westminster Library into an antechamber with staircases to the left and
    right and another set of swinging doors in the middle. I started towards
    the doors, but noticed a bulletin board with a sign that read, amongst
    announcements for other clubs and organizations, that the chess club meets
    in multipurpose room 103. Assuming this meant the third multipurpose room
    on the first floor, I walked up the left hand flight of stairs and entered
    a reading room with a long circulation desk. Behind this desk, a single man
    sat at his computer, immersed in whatever the screen was showing him. Every
    couple seconds, he would look down at his keyboard, pause, tap a key with
    his index finger, pause, and look back at the screen. I stood in front of
    him, in the hopes that he would take notice of me and be able to help.
</p>
<p>
    Click. Click. Click.
</p>
<p>
    “Um, sorry…” I said to get his attention
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah. Just… one… s…” he trailed off, still staring at the screen. Click.
</p>
<p>
    Eleven keystrokes later, a woman walked behind the desk carrying a stack of
    books, and upon my asking about the chess club, insisted on leading me
    thre, two flights of stairs down the rabbit hole to the basement.
</p>
<p>
    Richard was leaning back with his hands behind his head and his legs
    crossed, staring deep into space. I asked him if this was the chess club.
    He took a couple seconds to reel in his thoughts, then turned to me and
    said yes, in fact it was. I waited for an invitation to take a seat
    opposite him, but he said nothing.
</p>
<p>
    “Are you in the middle of something, or do you want to have a game?” I
    asked. Richard looked down at the board. He looked up, said yeah and
    started talking about Mary as I sat down and took off my coat. He was
    talking about the library changing the weather when I made my first move,
    and then he leaned forward onto his elbows and the game began.
</p>
<p>
    I am sure I am the only person in this room under forty, and yet I’m still
    too old to be a beginner. Most people who reach grandmaster status started
    playing before the age of nine; maybe it’s something in the way the brain
    develops, or the necessity of a total and lifelong commitment to the game
    that can only crystalize before puberty, but somehow, unknowingly, I’ve let
    my chances of mastering chess slip away from me. There are 318,979,564,000
    possible first four moves to a chess game, a number as enticing as it is
    intimidating. The more one plays and the more everyone plays, the smaller
    this number really gets to win the game, and maybe that’s why I would’ve
    needed to start playing eight years ago, because I am nowhere near wrapping
    my head around three hundred trillion.
</p>
<p>
    It’s a number so large that nobody can ever wrap their head around it
    entirely. Chess has existed for about 1400 years, and no one has ever
    remained undefeated, no one has displayed such an irrefutable mastery of
    the game that he or she clearly had it all figured out. That is, until Deep
    Blue beat Gary Kasparov, the reigning world champion and second highest
    ranked player of all time, in a six game match. Kasparov won the first
    game, when Deep Blue resigned after 45 moves. Kasparov lost the second game
    though, a huge psychological blow that many, including Kasparov himself,
    attest as a major reason for his loss of the whole match. The third through
    fifth games were draws, and while games one, two and six are widely
    analyzed by YouTubers and websites from 1997, its as though games three
    through five didn’t happen. But then again, no one was ever interested in a
    tie between man and the machine. Someone had to lose.
</p>
<p>
    It all came down to the sixth game, in which Gary Kasparov resigned after
    only 19 moves. It was the earliest he’d ever resigned from a game.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="TOPPAGE">
        “It’s hard to take,” someone called Carol Haunton said regarding
        Kasparov’s loss to Deep Blue/IBM/the machine in an MSNBC interview. “I
        don’t want to feel like I belong to some Orwellian society.”
    </a>
    I’m not fully on board with Carol’s Orwellian take on things—and I suspect
    she was imagining more of an Asimovian society—but she’s right that there’s
    something upsetting about the loss. For me, it’s less about the human race
    being superseded by computers, and more about the idea that we’ve reached
    the end of something that we’ll never get back.
</p>
<p>
    There is a subtle aroma of burning dust in the room coming from the
    ventilators. Another unknown figure comes into the room and between low
    murmurs sits down next to the lone man to my southwest. I’ve just lost my
    one chance of beating Richard, I think. Richard has swiped back his rook,
    and all my imagined planning with it. I capture his pawn with my formerly
    game-winning knight. From where I’m sitting, his advanced queen is
    highlighting just how weak my defense is. Richard takes his hands off his
    ears to make his move and for a brief moment, a blanched outline of his
    fingers is left on his head. Richard is probably still tense because he let
    his guard down and he thinks I almost beat him. He moves his queen so that
    my king is in check, and my knight is threatened. I move my knight between
    his queen and my king, blocking the check, and protecting the knight with
    my queen. Richard puts more pressure on the knight with his back rank rook.
    I move my king. He moves his knight. I move my queen. He looks at me with
    his eyebrow raised and takes my knight. The knight is hanging, and there’s
    no gambit this time. At this point, Richard realizes, finally and
    irrevocably, that I do not know what I am doing.
</p>
<p align="center">
    ♔
</p>
<p>
    I was born in Morristown, New Jersey, and my family lived there for the
    first three years of my life. Due to an itinerant father, my family then
    preceded to move to Phoenix, Arizona for a year, back to Morristown, New
    Jersey for five years, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin for five years and then to
    London, England, where, having regularly molted family members along the
    way, my mom and I now live.
</p>
<p>
    I have two early memories of chess. The first is of the giant chessboard
    with three foot tall pieces at the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix. I was three
    when I lived there, so I don’t think I ever played on this board then, but
    when my family and I would come back to visit friends in the greater
    Phoenix area we would eat lunch at the hotel at least once per stay. It was
    always incredibly sunny and we always all got pink lemonades, and there was
    always a mini bottle of Tabasco sauce that came with the table that my dad
    would pocket. While my dad was paying the bill, one of my brothers and I
    would play a game of chess on the giant board. I don’t think I ever won.
    I’m not sure if I just became more perceptive, or the hotel’s upkeep
    started to decline, but it seemed like the white chess pieces and squares
    became progressively more scuffed over the years, the sparrows became more
    and more aggressive in scavenging for food until they were circling us,
    brushing our hair with their wings as we ate.
</p>
<p>
    The second is of a Lego Chess computer game that my brothers and I used to
    play when we lived in New Jersey for the second time. We had a chunky
    Compaq monitor with an accompanying chunky CPU box in a wood paneled corner
    of our living room that I used to sit at for too long playing Backyard
    Baseball, Freddi Fish and Dragonfire. The Lego Chess games took place on a
    pirate- or cowboy-themed board with Lego figurines representing each piece,
    and when you moved a piece it would walk to its new position (or in the
    case of the king and queen in the pirate mode, be carried on a plank by
    monkeys). If, for instance, you were in cowboy mode and you took the
    opposition’s pawn with your knight, the offensive caricature of a Native
    American that represented their pawn would disappear in a puff of dust.
    Then there was a short cut-scene animation of a Native American with an axe
    that had snuck up on a cowboy adjusting his horse’s saddle. As the Native
    American wound up to throw the axe, the axe head flew backwards off the
    handle, and the cowboy heard this, I guess, and turned to point his gun at
    the Native American. The Native American ran away, and the cowboy smiled
    while a victorious trumpet noise played.
</p>
<p>
    There was a cut-scene for each piece captured and for each win, and to me
    these scenes always sort of implied that chess was only a stand-in for
    another conflict. I think that is pretty fundamental to why I have always
    wanted to play chess. In the beginning of these Lego Chess games, I would
    have my war strategies laid out, of sneaking behind enemy lines or luring
    their pieces into a trap. In my head, I would win in a shocking display of
    genius as the veil fell away from my plans and the enemy was left helpless.
    In reality, the computer would make a move within the third or fourth turn
    that would ruin my plans, and instead of adjusting I would try more and
    more tangentially to continue to follow my original plan, and of course
    this would only make things worse.
</p>
<p>
    There were three levels of increasing difficulty that you had to get
    through to win. The first level was programmed to be really easy, and I
    could almost always win. The second level was much harder, and I could only
    get through if I was lucky. The third level was pretty much impossible; I
    beat it only once. I don’t know exactly what I had imagined winning would
    be like, but the reality wasn’t anywhere close. I remember it was in the
    late afternoon on a warm day, but the corner of the room with the computer
    was darker and colder, a place the sunlight never reached. My head felt
    muddled from too much time spent with a screen, and I knew even then that I
    should have been outside in the brightness instead of on the computer. I
    walked out onto our brick patio and I could feel the warmth on my bare feet
    and the weight of the air on my body. I had the uneasy feeling that I’d
    done something wrong by spending that time indoors, like if my mother found
    out, she would be disappointed but she’d try to hide it. I dug an old
    soccer ball out of some long grass and started kicking it around in our
    backyard, and the bad feelings started to fade away. How could I have known
    then, Richard?
</p>
<p align="center">
    ♔
</p>
<p>
    Richard moves his knight three squares, putting me in check. I counter
    rather weakly by moving my king out of the way. Richard moves his queen one
    square diagonally forward, putting me in check again. I’m on the run now;
    all I can do is move my king again. He moves his bishop five squares
    diagonally, putting me in check for the third time in a row. This time I
    block him with my bishop. He moves his queen five squares directly forward,
    and takes the bishop, and it’s pretty much game over. Three, one, five,
    five, and now here I am, with Richard, in the Westminster Library.
</p>
<p>
    “Is that the game?” I ask.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah,” he says softly, calmly. “Alright.”
</p>
<p>
    It’s eight when I walk back out the swinging door. The drizzle had turned
    into something heavier while I was inside the library, and I can hear the
    car tires peeling through the water. Richard must have been playing chess
    for some time now if he ran the club, and yet he and I had had a fairly
    close game. Richard is closer to that three hundred trillion than I—but not
    that much closer. And yet if there’s one thing I’m sure of about Richard,
    it’s that every Tuesday night he’ll be there in the basement, rain or
    shine, even if no one else comes. I was only thinking about my plans when
    we were playing, but he must have been planning something too.
</p>
<p>
    I’m starting to think he was right about everything.
</p>
<p>
    I stand on the street for a while. The rain is a welcome cold on my face
    after the dry heat of the basement. I look up. The rain is a veil over the
    sky. If you were to follow the direction of my gaze though, you would
    travel through the veil. Through the stratosphere, and the mesosphere, and
    the exosphere, and into a vacuum. And if you kept going, past the moon and
    the sun and the galaxy, deeper and deeper into the universe, and you turned
    around, you would be able to see trillions of stars. I stand there for a
    while, with the rain running down my face, and then turn back towards home.
